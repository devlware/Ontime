Ontime is a project created to study python, also it was conceived as a chanllenge.
Try to download all the schedule for public bus lines, this information should be easier to access, I don't see the need to have a captcha on the site.

City Hall's web site where we can find information about the schedule for the public bus lines http://www.urbs.curitiba.pr.gov.br/PORTAL/tabelahorario/
Right now the script just downloads several captcha files and store its fingerprint (image file sha1) into database.
From the data we can tell that there is 15 captcha image files available. Each image file code is already mapped on captcha_code.txt file.

Next move:
- Code the steps to read the cityhall's site and ask for information about a line.
- Study how to parse the information and store it.

Thanks to the Python team for doing such a great programming language.
Thanks to Leonard Richardson (leonardr@segfault.org) for releasing BeautifulSoup.
